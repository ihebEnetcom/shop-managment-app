## Running Locally

To run this application on your local computer, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm) installed.

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Open a terminal in the project's root directory and run the following command to install all the necessary packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the Development Server:**
    Once the installation is complete, start the local development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Open the App:**
    Your application will be running at [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002). Open this URL in your web browser to see it in action.

The application uses a local SQLite database (`local.db`), which will be created automatically in your project folder when you first run the app. All your data will be saved there.
